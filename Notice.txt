Software Engineering Project – Source Code Access Notice
Project Overview

This project was developed as part of our Software Engineering course.
The game was created in collaboration with Futuristic Studio under a formal agreement.

The project involved real production workflows, industry practices, and collaboration with an external studio team.

Source Code Availability
The complete source code for this project cannot be uploaded to GitHub.

Reason is simple and non-negotiable:
The source code is the intellectual property of Futuristic Studio.
Uploading or sharing the code publicly would be a direct violation of the collaboration agreement and IP terms.

Because of this legal and ethical restriction, it is literally impossible for us to push the full project code to this repository.

Verification and Evaluation
To verify the authenticity and completion of the project, we can provide:
Steam link of the published game : https://store.steampowered.com/app/3969640/PENANCE/

Note
This repository exists only to document the project context and constraints.
Lack of source code upload does not indicate lack of contribution or incomplete work, but compliance with professional IP agreements.
